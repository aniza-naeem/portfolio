A fun project to analyze your personal Gmail account. This is my final project as part of my Data Analysis course at ReDI school of Copenhagen. Project is written in Python and does the following.

How many emails did I send during a given timeframe?​

At what times of the day do I send and receive emails with Gmail?​

The busiest day of the week in terms of emails?​

What is the average number of emails per day?​

What is the average number of emails per hour?​

What are the most active emailing days?​

What am I mostly emailing about?​
